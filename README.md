Expense Analysis & Prediction Web App | MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, TensorFlow (Jan’24 – Mar’24 )
– Developed a full-stack finance management web app to record income and expenses, compute net profit/loss, future
value, and tax liability. Users can manually input data or upload Excel files, which are parsed and stored via a robust
Node.js + MongoDB backend; the data can also be downloaded in Excel format.
– Built modular RESTful APIs using Express.js for seamless CRUD operations, and designed a responsive, user-friendly
frontend using React.js, with dynamic bar and pie charts rendered via Recharts to visualize financial patterns and
category-wise distributions.
– Integrated a predictive analytics module using TensorFlow, which analyzes both real-time and historical financial
inputs to forecast future income and expenses, enabling personalized budgeting and financial planning.
